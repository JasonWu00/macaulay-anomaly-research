# Identifying Anomalies in Datasets Using Deep Learning

Research assistants: Lamiya Serhir, Ze Hong Wu

### Project Description

The contents of this GitHub repo describes a research project that we partook in under the guidance of professor Aftab Ahmad from John Jay College. As part of this project we worked on identifying anomalies in datasets using deep learning (as the title suggests). More specifically, we are (as of 23 January 2024 9PM EST) working to produce a machine learning model that can identify body movements based on brain signals.

### Project Structure

This project is split into a fall semester portion and a spring semester portion.

#### Fall semester

During the fall semester we picked up on the basic skills required for building and training a machine learning model. 

In this capacity we vertified the findings of a research paper that used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify brain tumors in MRI scans. The paper in question is ["Accurate brain tumor detection using deep convolutional neural network"](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370(22)00373-7/fulltext), published on 27 August 2022 on the [Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/). 

The authors of this paper deployed two different models to identify anomalies in brain scans, the code for which can be found [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/saikat15010/Brain-Tumor-Detection). We replicated their work in a number of Google Colab notebooks, following their instructions as closely as is possible (with only changes required to make the code run properly implemented). These Google Colab notebooks are in the fall-semester-work folder. With the exception of a couple changes to account for technology version differences, our very similar replication code produced similar results.

Through this paper verification we learned the basics of building and training a neural network using the paper as a blueprint.

#### Spring semester

During the spring semester we will focus on producing the machine learning model discussed in the project description. This section will be updated as progress comes in.

### Technologies

The production of this machine learning model will involve:
- Python
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for training the models)

### Replicating Our Work

The Python Notebooks included in the Fall and Spring folders include instructions on running them on your local machine or on Google Colab.
